Hey HWU community,

I hope this post finds you well. I wanted to provide a quick update on the development of Harmony Within Us (HWU). As many of you know, our shared journey toward creating a supportive and inclusive space is incredibly important to me.

Due to a heightened focus on my mental health and overall well-being, I've made the decision to temporarily pause the development of HWU. It's crucial for me to take this time to ensure that I can continue to contribute positively to our community.

I want to reassure you that this pause is not a goodbye or an end. It's a necessary step to prioritize self-care, and I believe it will ultimately lead to a more robust and impactful HWU in the long run.

I understand that many of you are excited about the project, and I truly appreciate your support and enthusiasm. Please don't worry â€“ Harmony Within Us is still very much alive, and I am committed to returning to development as soon as possible.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support. Let's keep fostering harmony within ourselves and our community.

Stay tuned for more updates, and take care. <3
