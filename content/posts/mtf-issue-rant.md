So, here's the deal. I never signed up for this whole MtF, gender dysphoria package. Like, seriously, who would willingly choose this rollercoaster of emotions? Not me.

*Let's rewind a bit.* Imagine waking up one day and realizing your gender compass is pointing in the opposite direction. It's like, "Hello dysphoria, my old friend. Can we not do this today?" But nope, life had other plans.

**And here's the kicker.** It's not a phase, it's not a choice. It's just me, dealing with this hand I've been dealt. I didn't wake up one morning and think, "You know what would be fun? Let's switch genders and see how that goes." Nope, not a thing.

*Let's talk about societal expectations.* I mean, come on. Why can't we all just be who we are without the constant judgment and raised eyebrows? It's exhausting. If got a euro every time someone said; "But why would you choose this?" I would be a millionaire.

If you ever wonder why I didn't choose an 'easier' path, well, it wasn't an option.

Sorry, rant over. Thank you for reading.
