After crying for over two hours straight, I chose to write a bit on my blogging website. As I haven't really updated anything on here in a long time, sorry for that.

I cried because of my realization that I have every so often about my life and how unfortunate it really is. Today's nonsensical reasoning was due to my dysphoria.

This is a draft... please come back later for more updates
