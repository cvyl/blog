Mom is *drunk-ish* again, I have been sick all week trying to get myself to study for all my missed and yet to come exams.

Unfortunately, due to sickness, it wasn't really possible for me to concentrate.

My mother believes I am just procrastinating, like she always thinks when I am unable to do something due to mental issues.

I feel like this world doesn't understand mental disorders.
