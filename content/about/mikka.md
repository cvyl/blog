# Who am I?

Hey! I'm a transgender girl who's been messing with computers since I was 9. I'm into cool stuff like stars and planets (astronomy), figuring out why people do what they do (psychology), and thinking about life and beliefs (philosophy and religion) and more.

I'm also trying to learn new languages and spend a lot of time just playing around with programming. Life's a bit of a puzzle, and I'm just piecing it together one interest at a time.
