      <description>Who am I? Hey! I&amp;rsquo;m a transgender girl who&amp;rsquo;s been messing with computers since I was 9. I&amp;rsquo;m into cool stuff like stars and planets (astronomy), figuring out why people do what they do (psychology), and thinking about life and beliefs (philosophy and religion) and more.
I&amp;rsquo;m also trying to learn new languages and spend a lot of time just playing around with programming. Life&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a puzzle, and I&amp;rsquo;m just piecing it together one interest at a time.</description>
